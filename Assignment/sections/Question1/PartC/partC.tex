\subsubsection{Introduction}

The aim of this section is to demonstrate the effects of data augmentation on
the performance of the neural network.

\subsubsection{Rational}

Data augmentation is a technique typically used in order to increase the size of
small datasets. Having more images, with unique features allows for the training
of a more robust neural network. By rotating, mirroring, and scaling images the
neural network can become more robust in real use cases to these variances in
input image.
