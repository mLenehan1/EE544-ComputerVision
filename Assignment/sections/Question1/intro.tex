The aim of section 1 of this assignment is to create an ``ImageNet'' style
classifier. The provided dataset contains pictures divided into 6 classes,
which are ``Church'', ``English Springer'', ``Garbage Truck'', ``Gas Pump'',
``Parachute'', and ``Tench''. The data has been provided in three subsets,
training, validation, and test subsets. This removes the need to do test-train
splitting. The dataset is relatively small, with a size of 1350 images
per class, totaling 8100 images,
compared to the 14 million images in the original ``ImageNet'' dataset.

The provided CNN structure is based on the ``VGG'' neural network. The base
network has a total of 9 layers. The input images are of size 224x224, and the
CNN must output a classification decision based on the the image classes. This
section of the assignment is divided into five sections. The first involves
building the base CNN. Subsequent sections build on top of this, adding dropout,
data augmentation, and batch normalization to the nerual network in order to
assess the performance impact of these features. The final section involves
creating a final version of the neural network, which has the highest achievable
performance.
