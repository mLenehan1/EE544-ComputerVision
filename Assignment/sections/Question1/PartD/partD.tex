\subsubsection{Introduction}

This section aims to add batch normalization to the neural network designed in
Part A. The effect on the neural network should be investigated in order to
determine if it increases the performance of the network.

\subsubsection{Rational}

Batch normalization works to alleviate the effects of covariate shift within a
CNN. Batch normalization allows for the use of higher training rates, and also
the use of less dropout within the network, due to the regularization effects it
has.
