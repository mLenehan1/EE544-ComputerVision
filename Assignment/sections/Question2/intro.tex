The aim of section 2 of this assignment is to implement ``Transfer Learning''
using a Resnet-50 model. The model must be adapted to the ``Food-101''
classification task, classifying images of foods which fall into the following
classes; Chicken Curry, Hamburger, Omelette, and Waffles. The dataset is yet
again pre-divided into training, validation, and test sets, therefore requiring
no pre-processing in order to be divided.

The Keras ``ResNet50'' model is used for this section of the assignment. This
model has 174 layers, as is specified in the assignment brief.
