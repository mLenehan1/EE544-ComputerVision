Using Keras, two separate image classification problems will be solved. The
first of these problems involves developing a classifier for a subset of the
ImageNet dataset. This classifier is based on the VGG-16D neural network.

The second problem involves performing transfer learning on the ResNet50 CNN.
The lower 141 layers of the base model must not be modified, with only the upper
33 layers being modified. This is done using the Tensorflow Keras ResNet50
model, and the freeze functionality which is built in.

Google Colab is used as the development environment for this assignment. With
access to a GPU, training can be accelerated. Colab allows for the importing of
data from a mounted Google Drive volume, the importing of Python libraries, and
the saving and exporting of the trained models.
